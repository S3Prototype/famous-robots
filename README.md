# Famous Robots

We present to you, the Famous Robots app!

The Mondo Robot team needs your help deciding which robot should
be added to the work space!

## Your mission:

As a user, your job is simple! Register an account, log in,
and browse a selection of robots curated by our lovely Admin.

Then vote for the robots you like the most! The Admin will add
new robots periodically, so check back frequently!

You can check on who's winning in the Results tab:

# Running the app.

The app is live at:
https://famous-robots.vercel.app/

But to run it locally, you'll have to change the URL's in the
fetch requests to http:localhost:3100, as that's the default
port the backend runs on.
