A list of tasks I would like to accomplish, as well as the days they were accomplished.
====================
TODO:

* Use dummy data to make voting, adding robots, deleting and vote-updating in the results page all work during a running instance of the app.
    * Votes show
    * Votes update
    * Votes disable button.
* Set up the backend to persist data about votes and existing robots
* Connect the backend to the frontend
* Set up user accounts and authentication
* Check the design doc for any missing features
* Try to implement oauth for signing in with twitter or google.
* 
DONE:

-------*
5/11/21
* Make Results page
    * Need to figure out how they're doing that progress bar. Is it custom, or is it in material ui?
* Make sure routing works in the dropdown menu on mobile as well.
* Set up routing so all the pages link to each other.

------*
5/10/21

* Make Robots page
* Make Admin page
    * Before doing this, I need to break things out into cleaner components.

------*
5/9/21

* Redo the login and registration pages with better integration of Material UI's grid.
    * Make it responsive.
* Make the navbar for the Admin/Robots page.
    * Make it responsive.
* Make the drawer menu for mobile, and make it only appear on mobile displays.

------*
5/8/21


* Create the login page.
    * Try out Material UI for this. Maybe it'll be a good fit.
    * Build the modal that contains the ui elements.
        * Calculate dimensions based on percentages of the pixels defined in the figma design doc.
    * Build the inputs.
        * The effect where the input labels overlap the input borders may be a little tricky.
            * Idea: Give the labels a background-color and negative margin so they overlap.
            ** Solution: This style was built into Material UI
* Create Registration page.
* Set up simple state management for switching between login and register
    * Have not set up buttons to alter these states yet.
